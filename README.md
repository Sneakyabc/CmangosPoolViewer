# CmangosPoolViewer
 This tool helps to visualize the placement and pooling of Cmangos gameobjects.
 
 I built this specifically to redo the mining node data throughout the database, but it should be useful for other purposes too. There's several features with this I'm sure are partially or completely broken, so if anyone feels the need to continue development on this, be my guest.
